# Project Summary
MyWonder is a new platform for big data analytics and visualization. Our wish is to provide users with easy access to create visualizations from massive files within a small amount of time, instead of waiting for hours. Our approach is to distribute the files on the cloud efficiently. With our product, our users can calculate their analytics and summaries from their phones very easily.
